# Dependency upgrade policy

**This is the canonical dependency-update policy (COMPAT-03, issue #474).**
Dependency bumps are the most frequent change class in this repo and the one
most likely to be waved through — this page states what gets applied
automatically, what needs a human, how fast a security fix must land, and
when a major version bump is allowed, so the answer stops being "whatever the
person merging felt like."

It covers five ecosystems, each with a genuinely different risk profile and
update cadence: **Go modules** (`backend/go.mod`), **npm/Yarn**
(`frontend/package.json`, `frontend/yarn.lock`), **Gradle**
(`android/**/build.gradle.kts`), **Docker base images** (the three
`Dockerfile`s), and **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/*.yml`).

## Selecting a new dependency

Before the tiers below (which govern *updating* what is already here), a note
on *adding* something new. A new direct dependency is a deliberate choice, made
in its own reviewed pull request — never bundled into an unrelated change, and
never vendored by copying source in. The bar:

- **Is it needed at all?** A few lines of first-party code beat a dependency
  whose transitive tree, release cadence, and abandonment risk we now own.
  This is why the frontend has no lodash-style utility grab-bag and the
  backend leans on the standard library.
- **Is it maintained?** A recent release history, a real issue tracker, and
  more than one contributor. An unmaintained package is a future security
  exception waiting to happen.
- **Is the license compatible?** MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0/ISC and similar are fine;
  copyleft (GPL/AGPL/LGPL) is rejected. This is enforced, not just intended —
  [`license-compliance.yml`](../.github/workflows/license-compliance.yml)
  gates the Go and npm trees, and
  [`dependency-review.yml`](../.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml) runs a
  vulnerability / license / typosquat check on the added dependency in the PR
  diff.
- **How is it obtained?** Through the ecosystem's own package manager into the
  committed lockfile (`go.sum`, `frontend/yarn.lock`, the Gradle version
  catalog) — see the pinning rules below. Nothing is fetched at build time
  from anywhere but the registry the lockfile records.

Once merged, a dependency is **tracked** three ways: the lockfile is the
authoritative list of what resolves; [`syft-sbom.yml`](../.github/workflows/syft-sbom.yml)
publishes a signed SBOM per merge to `main` and per release (see
[`docs/security/release-verification.md`](security/release-verification.md));
and bundled non-manifest content (fonts, icons) is listed in
[`THIRD_PARTY_SOURCES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_SOURCES.md). Updates from there on
follow the tiers below.

## The three tiers

Every dependency change falls into exactly one of these. The tier is decided
by severity and version-bump size, not by which ecosystem the dependency
belongs to.

### Security fixes

The fastest lane. Triggered by any of: a GitHub Dependabot security alert, a
[grype](../.github/workflows/grype.yml) CRITICAL/HIGH finding (runs on every
push to `main` and nightly, `fail-build: true`), a Trivy CRITICAL/HIGH
release-gate finding (`docker-publish.yml`, fixable CVEs only), a
`govulncheck` reachable-vulnerability finding, or a manually reported
GHSA/CVE against a dependency this project ships.

Two cases, because some of these triggers already gate CI and some only
reach a human as an alert:

1. **Already blocking a live gate** — `govulncheck` (every backend PR and
   nightly, `unit-tests.yml`) and grype (every push to `main` and nightly)
   both hard-fail the build the moment a reachable CRITICAL/HIGH shows up.
   Nothing merges to `main`, and no image gets published (Trivy's release
   gate), while the vulnerable state exists — the "response time" here is
   immediate by construction, not a target to hit.
2. **Reaches only as an alert or report** — a Dependabot Security Advisory
   with no version-update PR yet, a `.grype.yml`-eligible finding that
   `ignore-unfixed` let through the push gate because there is genuinely no
   fix upstream, or a GHSA/CVE reported by hand. Target: **Critical/High
   triaged and either fixed or recorded as a time-bounded exception (below)
   within 5 business days** of the alert appearing — the same acknowledgment
   window [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) already commits to for externally
   reported vulnerabilities, reused here for one project-wide number instead
   of a second invented one. **Medium/Low folds into the next weekly
   patch/minor batch** rather than getting its own timeline.

### Patch and minor

Batched and largely automated, because CI is trusted to catch breakage at
this size. `.github/dependabot.yml` already does the batching: weekly PRs per
ecosystem, grouped `minor-and-patch` updates into one PR per group, with a
7-day cooldown (a fresh release gets a week to be pulled if it turns out to
be a compromise before Dependabot offers it). A patch/minor PR merges once
the full relevant CI suite is green — build/test/lint, `dependency-review.yml`
(new-dependency vuln/license/typosquat check on the diff),
`license-compliance.yml` where a manifest changed, and the security gates
above — no separate design review is required beyond skimming the diff and
changelog for anything touching a security-sensitive path (auth, crypto, the
SSRF guards, a hostile-input parser). There is deliberately no auto-merge
workflow: a human still clicks merge, but does not need to re-derive what CI
already verified.

### Major

Never grouped, never automated — `dependabot.yml`'s `minor-and-patch` groups
exclude major bumps by construction, so they always arrive as individual PRs.
Each one is reviewed deliberately: the PR description states what changed
(linking the dependency's own release notes) and why the bump is safe, and —
per "Tying this to the compatibility matrix" below — whether it raises this
project's own supported-runtime minimum. There is no fixed SLA; review
bandwidth decides the pace, but a stale major-bump PR gets closed and
re-opened by Dependabot rather than left to rot indefinitely.

## Pinning rules

Three pinning rules exist today, and all three are enforced mechanically, not
just by habit:

- **The Go toolchain is pinned deliberately** (`backend/go.mod`'s `go` and
  `toolchain` directives) per the security posture in `CLAUDE.md` — it is not
  floated, and a bump is a deliberate edit to that one file, reviewable in
  the normal diff.
- **GitHub Actions are pinned by commit SHA**, not a floating tag — every
  `uses:` line across `.github/workflows/*.yml` names a 40-character SHA with
  the human-readable version as a trailing comment (`actions/checkout@3d3c42e…
  # v7.0.1`). This is not just convention: `zizmor` (`.github/workflows/zizmor.yml`)
  audits every `.github/**` change (plus a weekly re-scan) for, among other
  things, an unpinned or impostor action reference, and hard-fails the check.
  A PR that adds a floating-tag `uses:` line does not merge.
- **Docker base images are pinned by digest**, not just a version tag — every
  `FROM` line in the three Dockerfiles names a `@sha256:…` digest alongside
  the tag (e.g. `golang:1.27.1-alpine@sha256:…`). `hadolint`
  (`.github/workflows/sast.yml`) lints all three Dockerfiles on every
  relevant change and flags an unpinned `FROM`.

**Known gap:** Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check still flags the
`npm install` fallback branch in the root and frontend Dockerfiles' dependency-install
conditional (`if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn install --frozen-lockfile; elif …;
else npm install; fi`) as unpinned, because its detector only credits the
literal `npm ci` token. The branch is dead code in this repo today — both
Dockerfiles always `COPY` a committed `yarn.lock`, so the `else` never
executes — but it is a real, open Scorecard finding, not a false alarm this
policy waves away. Tracked, with the reasoning for not removing it yet
(behavior for anyone building from a stripped-down context), at **issue #331**.
This is the one place today where the stated pinning rule and what CI
enforces genuinely diverge; recorded here with its owner rather than
pretending the pinning is complete.

**Permanent exception — the SLSA generator reusable workflow.** The
`apk-provenance` job in `docker-publish.yml` calls
`slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@v2.1.0`
by **semver tag**, and Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check flags it as
"third-party GitHubAction not pinned by hash" (dropping that sub-score to 9).
This one is **by design and will not be fixed**: the SLSA trusted-builder model
requires the reusable workflow to resolve its own ref to establish the builder
identity in the provenance, so `slsa-github-generator` explicitly refuses to
run when referenced by commit SHA — a hash pin would break the very artifact
(`mycorrhizal-apk.intoto.jsonl`) the job exists to produce. Scorecard has no
suppression mechanism for Pinned-Dependencies, so the finding stays visible;
it is accepted here. Upgrades to the generator are a deliberate tag bump
(Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem proposes them), reviewed like any
other dependency major. `zizmor`'s equivalent `unpinned-uses` finding is
suppressed inline with `# zizmor: ignore[unpinned-uses]` on that line, and the
verification consequence is documented in
`docs/security/release-verification.md`.

**Gradle is now locked too (issue #942).** Every module's `release`
compile/runtime classpaths — the classpath that actually becomes the
published APK — carry a committed `gradle.lockfile`
(`android/build.gradle.kts`'s `subprojects` block registers
`resolveAndLockAll` to regenerate them and `verifyDependencyLocks` to check
them without writing). `debug`, test, and the app's benchmark-only build type
are deliberately excluded: they never ship, and resolving several of AGP's
internal project-to-project configurations outside its own variant-aware
task graph hits a real (locking-unrelated) variant-ambiguity error — see the
doc comment above `subprojects` for the full reasoning. With a lockfile per
module, `license-compliance.yml`'s Trivy license scan can finally enumerate
Gradle licenses the same way it already reads `go.sum`/`yarn.lock` — the
`android-license` job downloads the real dependency files
(`downloadLicenseScanArtifacts`, this ecosystem's equivalent of `go mod
download`) before scanning. Android dependency risk is no longer covered by
Dependabot's `gradle` ecosystem entry alone.

## When an update cannot be applied

Sometimes the target of the "Security fixes" tier's 5-business-day window
cannot be hit — there is no upstream release yet, the fix is blocked by
another pin (the `nanoid` case in `CLAUDE.md` is exactly this shape: pinned
at the last patched, CommonJS-capable release because nothing newer works
with this build's postcss/vite), or a license question is still open. The
answer is a **recorded, time-bounded exception**, never silence:

[`docs/security/dependency-exceptions.ignore`](security/dependency-exceptions.ignore)
records one entry per unresolved advisory — the advisory ID, ecosystem,
package, when it was first opened, when the current window opened, when it
expires (at most 90 days out — the same default review period
[MAINT-01 (issue #490)](breaking-change-policy.md) uses for a deprecation
window, reused here rather than inventing a second number), how many times
it has been renewed, the owner, and why it cannot be fixed yet. `cd backend
&& go run ./cmd/depexceptions` parses and validates that ledger — malformed
entries fail, and **an entry whose `expires` date has passed fails the
check** — and runs alongside `citecheck` in `unit-tests.yml`'s
`backend-checks` job, so it executes on every backend PR and on the nightly
full-suite run (`unit-tests.yml`'s `schedule` trigger), which means an
expired exception gets surfaced within a day even with no PR activity to
trip over it.

This is deliberately a different shape from this repo's existing permanent
ignore lists (`.trivyignore`, `.grype.yml`, `zap/dast.ignore`,
`schemathesis/schemathesis.ignore`, `docker/cis-hardening.ignore`,
`android/.mobsf`, `docs/security/citation-drift.ignore`,
`docs/security/crypto-surface.ignore`). Those record "the scanner is right
that this pattern exists, but it does not apply to how we use this
dependency" — a decision that can stand forever once written down. The
dependency-exceptions ledger records the opposite situation: a real,
applicable advisory that is temporarily unfixed. An exception that is still
open when it expires must be resolved (apply the fix) or renewed (a fresh
dated window, an incremented `renewals` count, and an updated reason) — it
cannot just sit there.

**Renewing is not free forever (issue #942).** A `renewals` count that keeps
climbing with nothing else changing is exactly the silent-forever-extension
failure mode a time-bounded exception was supposed to prevent in the first
place — an unfixable CVE could otherwise sit behind perpetual quiet 90-day
renewals indefinitely. Once an entry's `renewals` reaches 2 (its third
recording — roughly nine months unresolved), `depexceptions` additionally
requires `reason` to contain an `escalated:` note. The bar is a written
decision, not a fixed remediation: "still waiting on upstream, checked
2026-11-01" is a valid escalation as long as someone actually looked and
said so.

## Tying this to the compatibility matrix

A dependency bump that raises this project's own supported-runtime minimum —
[`docs/development/supported-runtime-matrix.md`](development/supported-runtime-matrix.md),
**issue #472** — is a breaking change under
[`breaking-change-policy.md`](breaking-change-policy.md) (**MAINT-02, issue #491**),
which lists "raises a supported-version minimum" as one of its
breaking-change categories. It is not an incidental side effect of a routine
bump. Concretely: before merging a bump that changes an `engines` field, a
`go`/`toolchain` directive, `minSdk`, or a base-image line whose own new
version declares a higher runtime requirement than the matrix currently
states, check whether it actually raises that floor. If it does, the PR
needs the breaking-change process that page describes (a deprecation window
per MAINT-01 if anything currently relies on the lower floor, a release note,
and — post-`1.0.0` — a major version bump), not a same-day merge on green CI.
This applies regardless of tier: even a nominally "patch" release of a
dependency can raise its own declared minimum Node/Go/JDK version.

MAINT-03 (issue #492), when it lands, classifies dependency-update issues
consistently with the tiers this page defines — this page is the source of
truth those classifications point back to, not a second one.
