# Data retention & deletion lifecycle

The answer to "where does every copy of this piece of data live, and when does the last one go away?"
for every data type this app produces. `docs/security/asvs-l2.md` V8.3.8/V8.3.2 cite into this doc rather
than re-deriving the same evidence; `docs/security/threat-model.md` covers what "compromised" means for
each asset, not how long it survives.

| **Scope** | Backend (Go/Gin + SQLite), CardDAV/CalDAV (server role), Android client, browser/frontend, operator backups. |
| **Companion docs** | `docs/security/pii-inventory.md` (the *minimization* lens — should each store exist, and is it more/kept-longer than needed), `docs/security/asvs-l2.md` V8 (Data Protection), `docs/deployment.md` (Backups section — the authoritative backup/restore runbook), `docs/security/masvs-l1.md` (Android storage controls). |

Every row below answers the same four questions from the issue: **where** it's stored and who can reach
it, **how long** it's retained, **how** deletion happens and whether it propagates to other copies, and
**whether it survives in backups**.

## The pattern this doc mostly confirms, not invents

[CLAUDE.md](/CLAUDE.md)'s backend trap #7 already fixes the *policy* per model (soft-delete for
user-authored content, hard-delete for edge/join rows), and the T26 purge job
(`backend/services/purge_service.go`) already hard-deletes soft-deleted rows past a retention window.
What follows enumerates every *copy* of the data — not just the primary table row — and checks each one
against the same four questions. Most rows below turn out to already be correct, wired years before this
doc; a handful of genuine gaps are called out explicitly in [Known gaps](#known-gaps).

## 1. Primary application data (user-authored content)

`Contact`, `Note`, `Activity`, `Reminder`, `LifeEvent`, `Preference`, `CadencePolicy`,
`ConversationAgenda`, `Gift`, `ImmichConfig`/`PaperlessConfig`/`SeafileConfig`/`WebDAVConfig`,
`Attachment` (metadata row only — see [§5](#5-attachments--profile-photos-files-on-disk)).

- **Where / who**: `mycorrhizal.db`, scoped by `user_id` in every query (CLAUDE.md trap #5). Reachable
  only via the authenticated owner's API session.
- **Retention**: live until the user deletes it; soft-deleted (`deleted_at` set) for
  `DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30, `config/config.go:70,150`) as an undo window (audit `Undo`,
  `audit_controller.go`) and a sync tombstone (T17 `?since=` feed).
- **Deletion / propagation**: `DeleteContact` (`backend/controllers/contact_controller.go:829-886`)
  cascades every dependent row via `deleteContactAssociations`
  (`backend/controllers/contact_controller.go:686+`) inside one transaction; `DeleteUser`
  (`backend/controllers/admin_user_controller.go`) does the account-wide equivalent. After the retention
  window, `PurgeSoftDeletedRows` (`backend/services/purge_service.go:25-135`) hard-deletes the row and
  its remaining edge references, run daily by cron and on-demand via the admin `TriggerPurge` endpoint
  (`admin_user_controller.go:37-42`). A `?since=` cursor older than the window gets `410 Gone`
  (`controllers/helpers.go:360-370`) — deliberately the *same* `DeleteRetentionDays` config the purge job
  reads, so a client can never observe a tombstone gap; propagation to CardDAV/CalDAV and the Android
  mirror is covered in §7/§8, both of which key off this same soft-delete state.
- **Backups**: yes, full row (including still-in-window soft-deleted rows) — see [§10](#10-backups).
- **Verification**: `backend/services/purge_service_test.go` (`TestPurgeSoftDeletedRows_*`, 8 cases
  including idempotency and "never touches live rows"); `admin_user_controller_test.go` M1/M1b/M5
  (window-pinned purge, live rows untouched, `TriggerPurge` executes).

### ContactShare snapshots (issue #574)

`ContactShare` (`backend/models/contact_share.go`) is a **frozen, independent copy** of a filtered
JSContact export of a contact, serialized once at share-creation time — no `deleted_at`, no FK back to
the original `Contact` (by design: the snapshot must survive the original being edited or deleted).
It sits outside the soft-delete model above precisely because it is a copy, not the live row.

- **Where / who**: `contact_shares` table, scoped to `from_user_id`/`to_user_id`. Reachable only via the
  authenticated sender's or recipient's API session.
- **Retention**: `CONTACT_SHARE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30, `config/config.go:72,153`) for **every
  status**, anchored on the moment the share stopped being actionable: `pending` ages from `created_at`
  (an abandoned invite cannot materialize years later); `accepted`/`declined` age from `responded_at`
  (the recipient has already imported or rejected the snapshot).
- **Deletion / propagation**: `PurgeExpiredContactShares`
  (`backend/services/contact_share_purge_service.go`) hard-deletes rows past the window, run under the
  same daily cron + job lock as the T26 purge (`PurgeDeletedRows`, `backend/services/purge_service.go`)
  and via the admin `TriggerPurge` endpoint. Deleting the snapshot destroys no one's real data: the
  sender's original `Contact` is untouched (no FK, by design), and an accepted share's payload was
  already imported into the recipient's account. `CONTACT_SHARE_RETENTION_DAYS<=0` is treated as
  "disabled", never "delete everything".
- **Backups**: yes — a share sits in every backup taken before the purge removes it; restoring such a
  backup resurrects a share whose purpose (and both parties' copy of it) is long since served.
- **Verification**: `backend/services/contact_share_purge_service_test.go`
  (`TestPurgeExpiredContactShares_*` — window-pinned per status, ages-responded-from-responded-at,
  `NULL responded_at` never purged, disabled-when-zero, idempotent). The frozen-snapshot design itself
  (as opposed to its retention window) is pinned separately by issue #555's
  `backend/controllers/contact_share_matrix_test.go` (`TestCreateContactShare_PayloadFrozenAtCreation`,
  `TestContactShare_PayloadUnchangedAcrossLifecycleTransitions`) and surfaced to the sender by
  `frontend/src/components/ShareContactDialog.tsx`'s `frozenNotice`.

## 2. Edge- and join-shaped rows

`RelationshipEdge`, `CircleMember`, `ContactTag`, `HouseholdMember`, `ContactSyncLink`,
`CalendarEventLink`, `FieldValue`, `activity_contacts`, `NotificationDelivery`, `ReachOutSuggestion`,
`ContactSyncConflict`.

- **Where / who**: same DB, same `user_id` scoping.
- **Retention**: none — CLAUDE.md trap #7 hard-deletes these immediately (a natural-key unique index
  would otherwise block re-creating the same edge after a soft-delete ghost).
- **Deletion / propagation**: removed synchronously in the same transaction as the owning entity's delete
  (`deleteContactAssociations`, `PurgeSoftDeletedRows`'s `cleanups` slice for anything that outlives a
  purged contact as defense-in-depth).
- **Backups**: no — gone before any subsequent backup is taken (unless a backup predates the delete, in
  which case restoring it resurrects the edge along with its endpoints — see §10).

## 3. Audit trail (`AuditEvent`)

- **Where / who**: `audit_events` table, append-only, tamper-evident hash chain (issue #381,
  `models/audit_chain.go`). Deny-listed fields never enter it (`models/audit.go`).
- **Retention**: `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90, `config/config.go:71,151`) — independent from the
  30-day content-deletion window, since audit's job is post-hoc investigation, not undo.
- **Deletion / propagation**: `PurgeExpiredAuditEvents` (`backend/services/audit_purge_service.go:26-45`)
  hard-deletes rows older than the window and re-links the surviving hash chain
  (`models.RecomputeAuditChain`) so tamper-evidence isn't broken by the purge itself. Runs daily via cron
  (`backend/main.go:184-190`); `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS<=0` is treated as "disabled", never "delete
  everything". No external mirror — audit never syncs to CardDAV/CalDAV/Android.
- **Backups**: yes, and a restored backup's audit trail is only as fresh as the snapshot.
- **Verification**: `backend/services/audit_purge_service_test.go` (`TestPurgeExpiredAuditEvents*`, 3
  cases including the re-link and a swallowed-recompute-failure case).

### System events (`SystemEvent`, issue #424)

`system_events` is the persisted operational-event timeline — application start/stop, scheduled job
runs, sync runs, notification dispatch, backup/restore drills. System-generated diagnostics, **not
user data**: no `user_id` scoping on the query (it records what happened to the *instance*), no
external mirror, admin-only over the API (`GET /admin/system-events`).

- **Where / who**: `system_events` table in `mycorrhizal.db`. Read only via an admin API session; no
  CardDAV/CalDAV projection, not in the Android offline mirror.
- **Retention**: `SYSTEM_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30, `config/config.go`) — short by design:
  long enough to investigate a recent incident, short enough to bound growth on a single-file
  database. Deliberately shorter than the 90-day audit window — operational noise is not an
  investigation record.
- **Deletion / propagation**: `PurgeExpiredSystemEvents`
  (`backend/services/system_event_purge_service.go`) hard-deletes rows whose `occurred_at` is older
  than the window, daily via cron (`backend/main.go`) under the `system_event_purge` job lock.
  `SYSTEM_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS<=0` is treated as "disabled", never "delete everything". No hash chain
  (unlike audit) — this is diagnostics, not a tamper-evident record. The free-text `error`/`detail`
  fields are sanitized + length-capped by `models.RecordSystemEvent`, and the model carries no
  high-cardinality fields (no contact IDs, no raw URLs) by construction.
- **Backups**: yes, and a restored backup's timeline is only as fresh as the snapshot.
- **Verification**: `backend/models/system_event_test.go`,
  `backend/services/system_event_purge_service_test.go`,
  `backend/database/migrate_system_events_test.go`.

### Webhook deliveries (`WebhookDelivery`, issue #622)

`webhook_deliveries` is the per-attempt receipt log for outbound webhooks: event type, status code,
error, retry state, and — before this ticket — a **full plaintext copy of the serialized entity that
triggered the event**. A `contact.created` delivery carried the whole contact record (names, emails,
phones, addresses). Surfaced by the #510 privacy/data-minimization review as the one high-volume table
#414's per-table window pattern missed.

- **Where / who**: `webhook_deliveries` table, reachable only via the owning webhook's owner session
  and admin (`webhook_controller.go`'s delivery-list endpoint is scoped to the webhook the
  authenticated user owns). The `payload` column is **never exposed by the API** — it exists only for
  retry replay, so trimming it is invisible to the UI.
- **Retention**: `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30, `config/config.go`), anchored on
  `created_at` — the moment of the delivery attempt. A row older than the window is far past every
  retry a webhook can take (max 3 attempts across a ~20-minute backoff), so the purge being the last
  word is a retention decision, not a lost delivery.
- **Payload minimization (the deliberate trim)**: a successful (2xx) delivery stores only the event
  envelope (`id`/`event`/`timestamp`) — `trimSuccessfulDeliveryPayload`
  (`backend/services/webhook_service.go`) drops the entity body because a 2xx row is never re-sent and
  the full body would serve no purpose. Failed/retrying rows keep the full body because
  `ProcessWebhookRetries` replays it verbatim. So the PII copy is now bounded *and* minimized: fresh
  failures may hold the body for re-send, successful receipts never do.
- **Deletion / propagation**: `PurgeExpiredWebhookDeliveries`
  (`backend/services/webhook_delivery_purge_service.go`) hard-deletes rows past the window, daily via
  cron (`backend/main.go`) under the `webhook_delivery_purge` job lock, and via the admin `TriggerPurge`
  endpoint. `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_RETENTION_DAYS<=0` is treated as "disabled", never "delete everything".
  Account deletion and webhook deletion still cascade as before.
- **Backups**: yes — a delivery (including any still-untrimmed failed row) sits in every snapshot
  taken before the purge; restoring such a backup resurrects it.
- **Verification**: `backend/services/webhook_delivery_purge_service_test.go`
  (`TestPurgeExpiredWebhookDeliveries_*` — window-pinned, failed-row policy, disabled-when-zero,
  idempotent, scheduled-lock) plus the trim pins in `backend/services/webhook_delivery_test.go`.

## 4. Sessions & short-lived secrets

Session/JWT cookies, TOTP recovery codes, password-reset tokens, API tokens.

- **Where / who**: httpOnly cookie (session) or DB row (API tokens, hashed); never in `localStorage`
  (pinned by the #419 Playwright regression, `frontend/e2e/`).
- **Retention**: token expiry per type (session TTL, reset-token TTL, recovery-code single-use — deleted
  in the same `WHERE` that consumes them, `services/twofactor.go:171-175`). API tokens live until
  revoked/rotated (issue #413).
- **Deletion / propagation**: logout clears the cookie server-side and `USER_INFO_KEY` client-side
  (`frontend/src/auth.ts:172`); revoke-all/rotate invalidate DB rows immediately.
- **Backups**: API token hashes yes; session cookies no (never persisted server-side to begin with).

## 5. Attachments & profile photos (files on disk)

- **Where / who**: `PROFILE_PHOTO_DIR` / `ATTACHMENTS_DIR` on the host filesystem, one file per
  attachment/photo, filenames server-generated (never user-controlled — path-traversal-safe).
- **Retention**: the metadata row (`Attachment`) follows §1's soft-delete/purge window, **but the file
  itself is deleted immediately**, not window-delayed (N7, comment at
  `backend/services/purge_service.go:48-49`): "an attachment's content IS the file; a tombstone that
  outlives a vanished file is acceptable for the change feed, an orphaned file is a leak."
- **Deletion / propagation**: `DeleteAttachment` (`backend/controllers/attachment_controller.go:244-263`)
  and `DeleteContact`'s `deleteContactPhotos`/`deleteContactAttachmentFiles`
  (`contact_controller.go:888-939`) remove the file from disk right after the DB transaction commits (file
  deletion can't be rolled back, so it happens after, not inside, the transaction). A failed file removal
  is logged as a leak but never fails the request.
- **Backups**: yes, if the operator's backup includes the photo/attachment directories — `docs/
  deployment.md`'s Backups section is explicit that a DB-only backup is *not* a complete backup for
  exactly this reason, and ships `rsync` commands for both directories alongside `make backup`.

## 6. Full-text search index (SQLite FTS5)

`contacts_fts`, `notes_fts`, `activities_fts` — derived, rebuildable indexes
(`services.RebuildSearchIndex`), not a second source of truth.

- **Where / who**: same SQLite file, `user_id UNINDEXED` column scopes every query to one user without a
  join.
- **Retention**: zero lag past the base table — `AFTER UPDATE`/`AFTER DELETE` triggers on `contacts`/
  `notes`/`activities` remove the FTS row the instant `deleted_at` is set (soft delete) or the row is hard
  deleted (`backend/database/migrations/000007_search_fts5.up.sql`,
  `000020_search_phones.up.sql`). A soft-deleted row is therefore unsearchable immediately, not merely
  after the purge window.
- **Backups**: yes, but irrelevant — a restore always includes the matching FTS state for that snapshot
  (same file), and a corrupted/missing index is always rebuildable from the base tables.

## 7. CardDAV / CalDAV (this app as the *server*)

External DAV clients (phones, desktop DAV apps) sync against `backend/carddav`, `backend/caldav`.

- **Where / who**: served straight from the live `contacts`/`activities`/`life_events` tables — no
  separate DAV-side copy exists.
- **Retention**: matches §1 exactly — a DAV client sees whatever the primary table currently shows.
- **Deletion / propagation**: `go-webdav` v0.7.0 (this project's DAV library) has **no RFC 6578
  sync-collection REPORT support** — there is no incremental delta protocol to push a tombstone through.
  Instead, `ListAddressObjects`/`ListCalendarObjects` query with GORM's default scope
  (`backend/carddav/backend.go:266-284`, no `.Unscoped()`), which — like every other query in this
  codebase — silently excludes soft-deleted rows. A deleted contact/event simply stops appearing in the
  *next* full listing a client requests (PROPFIND/REPORT), which is how these clients already detect
  removal without a native delta protocol. `DeleteAddressObject` (`backend/carddav/backend.go:385-413`)
  performs the same soft delete a REST client would, so a delete initiated *from* a DAV client propagates
  back into §1's normal lifecycle (undo window, purge, etc.) identically.
  - **Practical implication**: propagation isn't "instant" in the push sense (there is no push) — it is
    "as fresh as the client's next poll", which is the existing, already-shipped design (see the ETag
    comment at `backend/caldav/backend.go:314`), not a gap this ticket introduces or needs to close.
- **Backups**: not a separate store — see §1.

## 8. Android offline mirror (Room)

- **Where / who**: `AppDatabase`, SQLCipher-encrypted end to end (issue #385,
  `android/core/data/src/main/kotlin/.../local/RoomCacheEncryption.kt`), keyed via Android Keystore
  (`RoomPassphraseStore.kt`). Local to the device; unreadable without the app's key even with root file
  access.
- **Retention**: a rebuildable cache, not a second source of truth — rows persist only until the next
  sync disagrees with them.
- **Deletion / propagation**: `ContactRepositoryImpl.applySync` (`android/core/data/src/main/kotlin/.../
  repository/ContactRepositoryImpl.kt:248-256`) reads the T17 `sync.incremental` id list from every list
  response and calls `dao.deleteByIds(ids)` — the same tombstone mechanism §1/§7 rely on, consumed
  correctly here too. A direct on-device delete (`deleteContact`) also removes the cached row immediately
  on success (`ContactRepositoryImpl.kt:137-141`). On logout or an invalidated session,
  `LocalDataCleaner.clear()` (`android/core/data/src/main/kotlin/.../local/LocalDataCleaner.kt`) calls
  `AppDatabase.clearAllTables()` **and** deletes `context.cacheDir` recursively — wiping the FTS4 index,
  Coil's photo disk cache, and the vCard-share `FileProvider` staging area together, so a "stolen device
  after logout" story leaves nothing recoverable outside the (encrypted) DB the OS itself controls.
- **Backups**: none — this is a device-local cache with no server-visible backup; Android's own
  Auto Backup is out of scope for app-internal DB files of this kind and isn't configured for it.

## 9. Browser-side storage (frontend SPA)

- **`localStorage`**: holds only `user_info` (id/username/admin flag/self-contact UID) and UI
  preferences — no auth token, no contact PII (`frontend/src/auth.ts:15,120`; pinned as a regression by
  the #419 Playwright spec asserting no long-lived credential ever lands in `localStorage`/
  `sessionStorage`/`IndexedDB`/URL). Cleared on logout (`auth.ts:172`).
- **Auth token**: httpOnly session cookie — never readable by JS or the service worker, so there is
  nothing for either to leak or need to clear.
- **Service worker cache**: `frontend/src/service-worker.ts` precaches only the static build (app shell)
  and runtime-caches same-origin `.png` requests (CRA's default scaffold route, `StaleWhileRevalidate`,
  LRU-capped at 50 entries). It never intercepts API calls — contact photos ship as base64 data URIs
  *inside* JSON API responses (`models/contact_record.go`'s `buildMedia`/`photostore`), not as separate
  image requests, so no contact PII ever passes through this cache. **No IndexedDB usage anywhere in the
  frontend.**
- **Backups**: not applicable — device-local, ephemeral, not part of any server backup.

## 10. Backups

- **Where / who**: operator-controlled, off-instance storage the operator chooses (`docs/deployment.md`
  Backups section). `make backup` (`backend/cmd/backup/main.go` → `database.BackupSnapshot`,
  `backend/database/backup.go`) takes a live `VACUUM INTO` snapshot — safe under WAL, verified with
  `PRAGMA integrity_check` before it's considered valid — of the SQLite file; photos/attachments are
  backed up separately (`rsync`, since they're plain files, not DB rows). Access is operator access:
  whoever can read the filesystem/backup store the snapshot lands in can read it, and the app itself
  never re-reads a backup file (the restore drill only ever creates its own fresh snapshot, in a
  scratch directory it deletes afterwards).
- **Confidentiality / encryption**: a snapshot is a **complete copy of sensitive data at full
  sensitivity** (issue #420) — `private`/`secret` fields, email addresses, password/API-token
  hashes, TOTP recovery-code hashes, the audit trail, and still-in-window soft-deleted rows. It
  inherits the DB's field-level at-rest encryption: encrypted columns travel as `encv1:` ciphertext
  and the wrapped DEK (`data_encryption_keys`) travels with them, but it carries the same
  FTS-plaintext exception as the live DB, and the photos/attachments directories are plaintext
  files. The master key (`DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, else HKDF-derived from `JWT_SECRET_KEY`) is **never
  in the backup** — a stolen backup alone yields ciphertext + hashes + the FTS-plaintext set, and a
  restore under a different key fails closed at boot. A JWT-derived master key means rotating
  `JWT_SECRET_KEY` makes old snapshots undecryptable; a dedicated `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` decouples
  them. Full operator statement: `docs/deployment.md`'s "Backup confidentiality & retention".
- **Retention**: **entirely operator-owned** — this app has no built-in backup rotation, expiry, or
  auto-deletion of old backup files, and deliberately won't (an app that can expire backups gives an
  attacker running as the app the same power — issue #505). A cron-scheduled `make backup` will
  accumulate snapshots forever unless the operator adds their own retention (e.g. a
  `find -mtime +N -delete` outside this app).
- **Deletion / propagation**: **does not happen automatically, ever** — deleting/purging live data has no
  effect on already-taken backup files. This is the one place in the whole lifecycle where "deletion
  propagates" is false by design, and `docs/deployment.md:165-167` already documents the direct
  consequence: restoring a backup **resurrects** anything that was soft-deleted (but not yet purged) as
  of that snapshot, since a file-level restore has no concept of "these rows were mid-undo-window".
  Soft-deleted data ages out of backups in two steps: it stops appearing in *new* snapshots once the
  purge window (default 30 days, `DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS`) passes, but it survives in every snapshot
  that predates that purge until the operator deletes the snapshot. There is no partial/selective
  restore.
- **Restore-environment security**: a restore is a point-in-time rollback; the automated restore
  drill (`backend/services/restore_drill_service.go`, issue #275) proves a snapshot restores into a
  scratch DB with matching row counts — and, since issue #420, that the snapshot's wrapped DEK
  unwraps under the current master key (`atrest.VerifyBackupDecryptable`), so a rotated/lost key is
  caught weekly in a throwaway DB rather than during a real disaster. The audit trail in a restored
  database is only as fresh as the snapshot.
- **Backups of backups**: N/A — recursion stops here by definition.
- **Verification**: `frontend/e2e/backupRestore.spec.ts` (full backup → destroy → restore round trip);
  `backend/services/restore_drill_service.go` + issue #275 (scheduled restore-drill job that proves a
  backup actually restores, not just that the file exists); `atrest.VerifyBackupDecryptable` +
  `restore_drill_service_test.go` (`TestRestoreDrillFailsWhenSnapshotNotDecryptable`,
  `TestRestoreDrillPassesWithEncryptedDatabase`, issue #420).

## 11. Exports (CSV / vCard3 / vCard4 / jSContact / audit log)

- **Where / who**: generated per-request and streamed directly to the HTTP response
  (`backend/controllers/export_controller.go`) — never written to disk server-side (no `os.WriteFile`
  anywhere in the export path). Once downloaded, the file is the requesting user's own device/browser —
  outside this app's retention control by definition (same boundary as any file a user saves from any
  web app). Issue #416 added a fifth export in this same category: `GET /audit/export`
  (`ExportAuditLog`), an unbounded CSV of the caller's own audit trail — same generation/no-server-copy
  shape as the other four.
- **Retention**: nothing server-side to retain.
- **Deletion / propagation**: nothing to delete — there is no export artifact that outlives the request.
  Sensitive-above-`normal` fields and CSV-formula-injection payloads are filtered/neutralized *before*
  the export leaves the server (`sensitivity` classification, ASVS 8.3.4). The audit-log export's
  `before_snapshot` column is omitted unless the caller explicitly passes `?include_snapshots=true`: it
  is already credential-redacted at write time (`auditDenyList`, `models/audit.go`) but is **not**
  filtered by contact-field sensitivity the way the other four exports are, so it is gated behind its own
  explicit opt-in rather than reusing `include_sensitive`.
- **Backups**: not applicable.

## 12. Import wizard staging

- **Where / who**: `ImportSessionManager` (`backend/services/import_session.go`) — **in-memory only**,
  never persisted to disk or DB.
- **Retention**: `sessionExpiry = 15 * time.Minute` (`import_session.go:18`). A tiny post-confirm
  tombstone (`confirmedImport`) survives a little longer so a client that lost the confirm response can
  retry idempotently, but it holds only the result/owner/expiry, not the original uploaded rows.
- **Deletion / propagation**: expires on its own timer; also fully lost on process restart (in-memory,
  by design — an import mid-flight during a restart must be redone, which is an acceptable trade for
  never writing uploaded-but-unconfirmed contact data to disk).
- **Backups**: never — can't be backed up if it was never persisted.

## 13. External integration credentials (WebDAV / Paperless / Immich / Seafile)

- **Where / who**: one config row per user per integration, app-password/API-key encrypted at rest
  (`services/credential_crypto.go`); the plaintext credential is never returned by the read endpoint.
- **Retention**: soft-delete with the T26 partial-unique-index pattern (a user may remove and
  re-add a connection without a soft-deleted ghost blocking it).
- **Deletion / propagation**: hard-deleted on account removal (`admin_user_controller.go:705-720`).
  **Deleting the connection here never deletes anything in the external service** — Immich/Paperless/
  Seafile/WebDAV content lives entirely under the user's own account on their own external service; this
  app only ever stores a reference/credential, never a durable mirror of that content. That boundary is
  deliberate, not a gap: this app has no authority to delete data the user manages in a separate product.
- **Backups**: only the encrypted credential row; the external content is that service's own backup
  story.

## 14. Operational self-check results (`operational_check_results`) — not user data

- **Where / who**: one row per named self-check (`db_integrity_check`, `restore_drill`, and an
  internal `_db_write_probe`), written by the scheduled jobs and read by the deep `GET /health`
  endpoint (issue #421). No `user_id` — it is server-global operational bookkeeping, like
  `job_executions`.
- **What it contains**: a check name, an `ok`/`failed`/`error` status, a timestamp, and a short
  detail string (an `integrity_check` problem line, or a restore-drill row-count mismatch such as
  `contacts: live=10 restored=9`). **No contact data, no credentials, no PII.**
- **Retention / deletion**: hard state, upserted in place — at most one row per check name, each
  overwritten on the next run. Not tied to any user, so account deletion neither touches nor needs
  to touch it. Dropped wholesale by migration `000038`'s `down.sql`.
- **Backups**: included in the DB snapshot like any other table; carries nothing sensitive, so it
  needs no special handling in the backup-confidentiality boundary (§10).

## 15. Alert state (`alert_states`) — not user data

- **Where / who**: one row per alert condition (`backup`, `disk_space`, `sync:contact_sync`, …),
  written by the scheduled alert evaluator (`alert_eval`, issue #428) and read only by that same
  job. No `user_id` — server-global operational bookkeeping, like `operational_check_results` and
  `job_executions`.
- **What it contains**: a condition key, an `ok`/`alerting` state, the timestamp it entered that
  state, a consecutive-failure count, and a short sanitized detail string (e.g.
  `disk usage 92% of /var/lib/mycorrhizal`, or a subsystem's last error as already sanitized into
  `system_events`). **No contact data, no credentials, no PII.**
- **Retention / deletion**: hard state, upserted in place — at most one row per condition, each
  overwritten on the next evaluation. Not tied to any user, so account deletion neither touches nor
  needs to touch it. Dropped wholesale by migration `000040`'s `down.sql`; the next evaluator run
  rebuilds every row from current subsystem health.
- **Backups**: included in the DB snapshot like any other table; carries nothing sensitive, so it
  needs no special handling in the backup-confidentiality boundary (§10). Excluded from the
  restore-drill row-count comparison for the same reason as `system_events` /
  `operational_check_results` — the evaluator writes it in the snapshot-vs-live window.

## 16. Background job runs (`job_runs`) — not user data

- **Where / who**: one row per scheduled-job invocation (`daily_reminders`, `calendar_sync`,
  `reach_out_detection`, the purge jobs, …), written by `main.go`'s job wrapper and read only via
  an admin API session (`GET /admin/job-runs`, `GET /admin/job-runs/health`, issue #391). No
  `user_id` — server-global operational bookkeeping, like `job_executions` /
  `operational_check_results` / `alert_states`. Not in any CardDAV/CalDAV projection, not in the
  Android offline mirror.
- **What it contains**: job name, trigger (`scheduled`/`initial`/`manual`), start/finish timestamps,
  duration, result (`success`/`failure`/`skipped`), an optional items-processed count, a short
  `detail` string, and the `correlation_id`. The free-text `error`/`detail` fields are sanitized +
  length-capped by `models.RecordJobRun`; the model carries no high-cardinality fields (no contact
  IDs, no raw URLs) by construction — same posture as `system_events`.
- **Retention**: `JOB_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30, `config/config.go`) — short by design, same
  reasoning as `SYSTEM_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS`: long enough to see a slow-creep duration trend, short
  enough to bound growth on a single-file database.
- **Deletion / propagation**: `PurgeExpiredJobRuns`
  (`backend/services/job_run_purge_service.go`) hard-deletes rows whose `started_at` is older than
  the window, daily via cron (`backend/main.go`) under the `job_run_purge` job lock.
  `JOB_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS<=0` is treated as "disabled", never "delete everything". Not tied to any
  user, so account deletion neither touches nor needs to touch it. Dropped wholesale by migration
  `000041`'s `down.sql`.
- **Backups**: included in the DB snapshot like any other table; carries nothing sensitive, so it
  needs no special handling in the backup-confidentiality boundary (§10).
- **Verification**: `backend/models/job_run_test.go`, `backend/services/job_run_health_test.go`,
  `backend/services/job_run_purge_service_test.go`, `backend/database/migrate_job_runs_test.go`,
  `backend/main_test.go` (`TestRunJob_RecordsOutcome`).

## 17. Import run history (`import_runs`) — user-scoped operational bookkeeping

- **Where / who**: one row per **confirmed** contact import (issue #651), written by
  `models.RecordImportRun` from `ImportSessionManager.Confirm` / `.ConfirmVCF` after the import
  transaction commits, and read only by its owner via `GET /api/v1/contacts/import/history`
  (newest 50). Unlike §14–§16, it **is** user-scoped: `import_runs.user_id` is the user who ran the
  import. Distinct from §12 (the in-memory wizard staging that holds the *uploaded rows*) — this is
  the durable *outcome summary* only.
- **What it contains**: the source format token (`csv` / `vcf` / `jscontact` / `records`), the five
  ImportResult counts (total processed / created / updated / skipped) and an error **count** — no
  error strings, no contact names, no field values, **no PII**. It cannot answer "which contact"
  or "what changed", only "how many, when, from what format".
- **Retention**: no dedicated purge job. An import is a rare, human-initiated action, so the table's
  growth is self-bounding (a handful of rows per user per year); the read endpoint caps its own
  output at 50. Rows are immutable once written — no update path.
- **Deletion / propagation**: hard-deleted with the rest of the account by `DeleteUser`
  (`admin_user_controller.go`, `Unscoped().Where("user_id = ?", …).Delete(&models.ImportRun{})`) —
  it is in the manual-cascade checklist and pinned by `controllers/delete_cascade_coverage_test.go`
  (bucket `go-cascade-user`). Not in any CardDAV/CalDAV projection, not in the Android offline
  mirror. Dropped wholesale by migration `000042`'s `down.sql`.
- **Backups**: included in the DB snapshot like any other table; carries nothing sensitive, so it
  needs no special handling in the backup-confidentiality boundary (§10).
- **Verification**: `backend/database/migrate_import_runs_test.go`,
  `backend/services/import_session_history_test.go`,
  `backend/controllers/import_history_controller_test.go`,
  `backend/controllers/delete_cascade_coverage_test.go` (`import_runs` seeded + swept in the
  DeleteUser sweep).

## 18. Prometheus metrics (`GET /metrics`, in-process) — not user data, not persisted

- **Where / who**: process memory only. A hand-rolled registry (`backend/metrics/`) holds counters
  and gauges that the middleware, the scheduled-job wrapper, and `models.RecordSystemEvent` update
  on the hot path; the values are rendered on demand at `GET /metrics` (issue #389). The endpoint
  is registered only when `METRICS_TOKEN` is set and every scrape is bearer-authenticated.
- **What it contains**: aggregate operational numbers with **bounded-cardinality labels only** —
  HTTP method / matched route *template* / status code, background-job name + result,
  `system_events` type/component/result, DB connection-pool counts, Go-runtime stats, and storage
  byte totals (SQLite file size, filesystem free/total). No `user_id`, no contact IDs, no raw
  request paths, no free text, no credentials. The route label is `c.FullPath()` (the registered
  template, never the concrete path), so an unbounded ID space cannot leak in.
- **Retention / deletion**: none — the counters live only in RAM, start at zero on every process
  start, and are never written to the database or any file. Account deletion neither touches nor
  needs to touch them. Restarting the container is a full reset.
- **Backups**: not applicable — nothing is persisted, so nothing is in a snapshot.

## Known gaps

One item surfaced by walking every data type through the four questions above. It does not block this
ticket's "at minimum" bullets (T26 purge + CardDAV/CalDAV + Android propagation are all already correct,
per §1/§7/§8), but it is a genuine, named gap rather than a silently-accepted one.

1. **API responses carry no `Cache-Control: no-store`.** Already tracked and accepted as `partial` at
   ASVS 8.1.1/8.2.1 (`docs/security/asvs-l2.md`) — noted here only because it's the one place a stale
   *cached* copy of contact PII could theoretically outlive a delete, on a shared/proxied browser. Not
   re-litigated here; that row already owns the gap and its own fix.
