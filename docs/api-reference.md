# API Reference

## Base URL

```
/api/v1
```

## Authentication

Auth endpoints (`/login`, `/register`, `/logout`, `/password-reset/*`) are public. All other endpoints require authentication.

Admin endpoints (`/admin/*`) additionally require the user to have the admin flag set.

Login sets an httpOnly JWT cookie. Subsequent requests must include it (i.e. send with `credentials: 'include'`). The cookie name and domain are configured via `COOKIE_DOMAIN` and `COOKIE_SECURE`.

Alternatively, API tokens can be used in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer mycorrhizal_<token>
```

API tokens are created and managed by each user under Settings → API Tokens (`/api/v1/api-tokens`); a token always has the rights of the user who created it, never admin rights. The plaintext token is only returned once at creation time.

## Error Responses

All errors follow the same structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Contact not found",
    "details": {}
  },
  "request_id": "…",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Common error codes:

| Code | HTTP status |
|---|---|
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | 401 |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | 401 |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 |
| `INVALID_INPUT` | 400 |
| `ALREADY_EXISTS` | 409 |
| `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | 413 |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | 429 |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 |

## Request IDs

Every request and response carries an `X-Request-ID` header created by the middleware.

| `POST` | `/contacts/import/records` | Start an import from a JSON batch of neutral Card/CRM records (bulk-import API for external clients) |

#### Bulk import contract (external clients)

The records endpoint is the repeatable bulk-import contract for external clients (e.g. the Android
app): it serves both a first-run "import your contacts" prompt and a standing "Import from contacts"
entry point with the same flow.

**Session lifecycle.** An import is a three-step, server-side-session flow:

1. `POST /contacts/import/records` (JSON batch, 1–500 records) — or an upload endpoint for a file —
   returns an `ImportPreviewResponse` with a `session_id`, per-row duplicate detection
   (`duplicate_match` + `merge_diff`), and within-batch detection (`batch_duplicate_of`).
2. (CSV only) `POST /contacts/import/preview` applies column mappings to the session.
3. `POST /contacts/import/vcf/confirm` (VCF/JSContact/records) or `/contacts/import/confirm` (CSV)
   executes the import with one action per row: `add`, `update` (merge into the matched existing
   contact), or `skip`. The response is an `ImportResult` summary.

**Idempotent confirm.** Confirming a session consumes it. A retry of the same `session_id` within
the 15-minute session window returns the **original result** as a no-op — it does not re-apply the
import. This makes a dropped confirm response safe to retry: a client that times out mid-request can
simply re-send the same confirm instead of re-uploading (which would create duplicates). To change a
decision, start a new upload (new `session_id`).

**Retry guidance.** If a confirm is retried and the session has aged out (>15 min, or the server
restarted), it returns `404 NOT_FOUND`; the client must re-upload. The confirm endpoints are
type-scoped: `/contacts/import/confirm` rejects records-sourced sessions and
`/contacts/import/vcf/confirm` rejects CSV-sourced ones — a retried confirm must target the same
endpoint the preview came from.

**Guarantees.** Sessions are scoped to the owning user; a foreign or expired `session_id` is `404`.
Sessions are held in memory only and lost on server restart. Batch limit is 500 records; the import
commits per-row, so one failing row does not abort the rest. Ownership scoping, per-row decisions,
and the 15-minute expiry are enforced server-side.


### Export

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/export` | Download all data as CSV |
| `GET` | `/export/vcf` | Download all contacts as VCF (includes photos) |
| `GET` | `/export/account` | Download the full-fidelity, re-importable account bundle (JSON; every sensitivity level and suggested rows included; size limit in the `X-Mycorrhizal-Bundle-Max-Bytes` header) |
| `POST` | `/import/mycorrhizal/upload` | Upload an account bundle; also `/import/mycorrhizal/fetch`, `/status`, `/preview`, `/confirm`, `/cancel` for the source-import flow |

### Feeds

Private Atom feeds ([ADR 0030](adrs/0030-feeds-atom-emission.md)). Feed management requires authentication; the feed itself is served to a feed reader by an unguessable token, not a session.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/feeds` | List the caller's active feeds (never returns a token) |
| `POST` | `/feeds` | Create a per-contact or aggregate feed; the feed URL, which carries the token, is returned once |
| `POST` | `/feeds/:id/rotate` | Replace a feed's token and revoke the old URL |
| `DELETE` | `/feeds/:id` | Revoke a feed |
| `POST` | `/feeds/revoke-all` | Revoke every feed the caller owns |
| `GET` | `/feeds/atom?token=…` | Public, rate-limited Atom document; every miss is an identical empty 404. Sensitivity-filtered |

### Network

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/graph` | Get contact network graph data |

### API Tokens

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/admin/api-tokens` | List all API tokens for the current user |
| `POST` | `/admin/api-tokens` | Create an API token — returns the plaintext token once |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/api-tokens/:id` | Revoke an API token |

`POST /admin/api-tokens` body:

```json
{ "name": "my token" }
```

Response includes `token` (the `mycorrhizal_…` plaintext value) only on creation. Subsequent list responses omit it.

### Admin

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/admin/users` | List all users |
| `GET` | `/admin/users/:id` | Get a user |
| `PATCH` | `/admin/users/:id` | Update a user (e.g. set admin flag) |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/users/:id` | Delete a user |

### Health

All three are unauth, unversioned, and accessible directly (without prepending the base URL). See
[deployment.md](deployment.md#health-liveness--readiness-endpoints) for which probe each consumer
should use.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health/live` | Liveness — is the process running? Returns immediately, no I/O. For restart policies. |
| `GET` | `/health/ready` | Readiness — can this instance serve? DB + migrations + filesystem. `503` when not. For traffic gating. |
| `GET` | `/health` | Deep health — the `healthy`/`degraded`/`unhealthy` roll-up, plus the build version and client-compat fields. Only `503`s on a DB read failure. The per-facet breakdown (job names, integrity/restore-drill state, integration reachability) is admin-only at `/admin/system-status` (issue #864). |
