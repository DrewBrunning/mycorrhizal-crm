# node-version: 22 pin (unit-tests.yml, e2e-tests.yml) rather than floating on
# node:lts-alpine the way frontend/Dockerfile (the split image) does -- this
# repo prefers an explicit, reproducible pin over a floating tag (see the Go
# toolchain note in CLAUDE.md). frontend/Dockerfile didn't need this change:
# lts-alpine already resolves past the floor (Node 24 as of 2026-08).

# Node no longer bundles Corepack (and therefore the `yarn` shim) as of v26 --
# confirmed empirically: present on node:25-alpine, gone on node:26-alpine.
# Install yarn explicitly so a future Node bump doesn't silently break this
# build the way #297 (node:22-alpine -> node:26-alpine) did (exit 127, "yarn:
# not found").
#
# A plain `npm install -g yarn@<version>` is a semver pin, not a hash pin --
# OSSF Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check only credits `npm ci` or a
# git+https URL pinned to a 40-char commit SHA, and yarnpkg/yarn's git tags
# don't include the built lib/ directory (it's produced by `gulp build`,
# gitignored, only shipped in the published npm tarball), so a git-SHA
# install doesn't actually work. Download the exact release tarball instead
# and verify it against its published sha512 (cross-checked against the
# registry's `dist.integrity` for yarn@1.22.22) before installing.
