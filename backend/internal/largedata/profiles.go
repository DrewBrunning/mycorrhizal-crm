// Representative benchmark-dataset profiles (PERF-01, issue #468).
//
// Every performance ticket in milestone v0.6.9 — #469 (core-operation
// benchmarks), #470 (data-movement benchmarks), #471 (budgets), #495
// (large-dataset migration), #498 (constrained-resource capacity) and #453
// (restore at scale) — runs against one shared, *representative* dataset. A
// benchmark over a thin flat dataset measures nothing that matters here: the
// operations that get slow are relationship traversal on a dense graph, FTS
// over a large corpus, and export over contacts with many repeatable fields,
// none of which appear in a thin dataset.
//
// A Profile is a written-down shape, not an adjective. It layers three things
// on top of the block-replicated canonical manifest (Scale, largedata.go):
//
//  1. a target contact count and a user count — multi-user is supported at
//     1.0.0 (#558), and per-user jobs/indexes scale with user count
//     independently of per-user data volume;
//  2. a NON-UNIFORM graph — Scale alone yields a disconnected forest of
//     identical 15-contact islands, but traversal cost lives in the tails, so
//     each profile adds a deep cross-block relationship chain and a set of
//     dense hub contacts;
//  3. an explicit seed, so a regression is reproducible and two runs are
//     byte-for-byte comparable.
//
// The pathological records the canonical manifest carries (the soft-deleted
// `gina` + `julie`-recreates-her-uid pair, the ~1700-char note, the Unicode
// and duplicate-detection data, the sensitive rows) are present in every
// block at every scale — a slow query is usually the one hitting the
// pathological record, not the average one.
//
// The catalogued numbers and their rationale are published for operators in
// docs/development/scale-profiles.md.

// Profile is one named benchmark-dataset shape.
