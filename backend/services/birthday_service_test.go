// TestGetUpcomingBirthdays_TruncatesAfterMaxResultsPastTwoWeeks is a
// regression test for the resultCount truncation loop in
// GetUpcomingBirthdays: once a birthday is both beyond the two-week window
// and past maxResults (5), the loop must stop growing resultCount for good
// (birthdays are sorted ascending by days-until, so nothing later in the
// slice would ever re-satisfy either condition). This exact loop was
// rewritten from an if/else chain to a switch during a lint cleanup pass;
// break inside a switch only exits the switch, not an enclosing for loop,
// so a naive conversion would have silently kept iterating instead of
// stopping — this test locks in the correct (labeled-break) behavior.
