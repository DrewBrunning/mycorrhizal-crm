// PurgeSoftDeletedRows hard-deletes soft-deleted rows older than the
// retention window. Called by both the scheduled cron job and the admin
// "purge now" trigger (T26).
//
// Purges in FK-respecting order: children before parents, so ON DELETE
// CASCADE declarations on the children can fire cleanly for the parents.
// Edge/join-shaped rows (activity_contacts, circle_members, contact_tags,
// etc.) that reference contacts are cleaned up explicitly before the
// contacts themselves are purged.
//
// A non-positive DeleteRetentionDays disables the purge (DELETED_RETENTION_DAYS=0
// is the documented "keep soft-deleted rows forever" value, .env.example). The
// guard is not merely a convenience: the cutoff is computed as now minus the
// window, so with 0 it equals now and with a negative value it lands in the
// future — either way `deleted_at < cutoff` matches the ENTIRE undo window and
// this job would hard-delete every soft-deleted row on the next run, including
// the boot-time Initial trigger in main.go. Every sibling purge (audit,
// contact-share, idempotency, job-run, system-event, webhook-delivery) carries
// the same guard for the same reason.
//
// It returns a non-nil error if any individual delete fails, joining every
// failure rather than stopping at the first (the cleanup is best-effort and
// must still attempt every table). The scheduled entry point passes that to
// releaseJobLock so a persistently failing purge is recorded as `failed` and
// job_stopped can fire, instead of every run advancing last_run_at as success.
