// webhookDeliveryPurgeMinInterval is slightly less than the 24h cron cadence

// PurgeExpiredWebhookDeliveries hard-deletes webhook_deliveries rows older
// than the retention window (WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_RETENTION_DAYS, default 30).
//
// This is the issue #622 decision, surfaced by the #510 privacy/data-
// minimization review. Every row carries a copy of the serialized entity that
// triggered the event — a `contact.created` delivery holds the whole contact
// record — so without this job a plaintext copy of every entity that ever
// changed accumulated in the table forever (the only prior deletes were
// cascade-on-parent: account deletion and the webhook row's FK). The window
// bounds that copy, and successful deliveries now also trim it (see
// trimSuccessfulDeliveryPayload in webhook_service.go).
//
// The window anchors on created_at — the moment of the delivery attempt. A
// row older than the window is past every retry a webhook could ever have
// taken (max 3 attempts across a ~20-minute backoff window), so purging a
// still-pending-retry row is not a lost delivery, it is the retention decision
// being allowed to be the last word; re-sending a month-old webhook is the
// same stale-PII hazard the window exists to bound.
//
// WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_RETENTION_DAYS <= 0 disables the purge rather than deleting
// every delivery, matching audit_purge_service.go's stance on a misconfigured
// window.
