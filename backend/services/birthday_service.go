// 1 March, so the count is "days until the celebration (1 Mar)", and returns 0
// on 1 March itself. Always forward-looking (never negative); malformed or
// year-less-too-short strings return the 999 sentinel. A value is never
// zone-converted — now.Location() decides which calendar day is "today", and
// the stored month/day is placed into it verbatim (Rule 2).
//
// The count is DST-safe: both instants are local midnights in now.Location(),
// and calendarDaysBetween rounds the elapsed absolute hours to whole calendar
// days instead of truncating — across a spring-forward two local midnights are
// 23 absolute hours apart, and truncation would silently report a birthday the
// day after the transition as "today". Fixed in DATE-02 (issue #483);
