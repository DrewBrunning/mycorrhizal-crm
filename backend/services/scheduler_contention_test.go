// TestSchedulerContention_ManyUsersOneWriter is the "many users on one
// instance" axis of issue #498. The scheduler is a single in-process gocron
// instance and every write in the app funnels through one SQLite writer;
// per-user background jobs (cadence, reach-out detection, webhook retries,
// storage sampling, purge) fan their queries out across the user set, so ten
// users on the same cadence is a contention profile one user with ten times
// the data never produces.
//
// The contract this pins: under that contention the shared writer never
// returns SQLITE_BUSY / "database is locked" (CLAUDE.md trap #9 —
// _txlock=immediate + busy_timeout must hold), the jobs complete without
// error, and the database stays structurally and semantically intact
// (PRAGMA integrity_check + ADR-0012 invariants).
//
// Issue #797: on a shared CI runner this test once flaked with a single
// SQLITE_BUSY. The retried gate pass absorbed it (required checks stayed
// green), but gotestsum retains the failed first attempt in the JUnit XML, so
// the informational "Backend Test Report" check — the pass with no rerun to
// paper over it — surfaced red. That noise is the whole issue.
//
// Root cause: a whole-process scheduling/IO stall, not lock-queue depth.
// Every transaction here is a short BEGIN IMMEDIATE hold (the writers'
// Contact-create hook chain is the widest), so genuine contention on a healthy
// machine queues writers in milliseconds. busy_timeout(5000) is a wall-clock
// budget, though — if the process makes no forward progress for >5s while a
// write lock is held (GC / runner preemption on a loaded 2-vCPU runner), the
// first waiter to run after the stall returns SQLITE_BUSY even though the
// writer was never saturated. A single such busy is environment noise, not a
// capacity failure: it cannot be reproduced locally (25x -race runs, 0
// failures) and no job is to blame — none of the six holds a write lock across
// a long body, and the only propagated busy is a pre-body acquireJobLock one.
//
// So the harness below retries a lock-busy write exactly once before
// recording it (retryLockBusyOnce). A busy after the full busy_timeout means
// the failed transaction persisted nothing, so the retry is safe and
// idempotent (and for a job it precedes any body work, so the body still runs
// at most once); a busy that survives the retry — the write lock contended
// across two full budgets — is the genuine sustained-saturation signature and
// stays a failure.
