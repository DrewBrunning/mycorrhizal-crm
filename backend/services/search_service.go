// Full-text search over contacts, notes, and interactions (T11,
// T11; addresses added by T38,
// T38; phones added by T69,
// T69). Backed by FTS5
// virtual tables kept in sync by triggers (migrations 000007 + 000010 +
// 000020); the index is derived data and can be rebuilt at any time via
// RebuildSearchIndex.
//
// Contact addresses are searchable through the denormalized
// contacts.addresses_flat column (maintained by Contact.BeforeSave and
// backfilled by migration 000010), indexed into contacts_fts like the other
// flat fields — the ticket's lowest-friction option, consistent with how the
// rest of the index works.
//
// Contact phones are searchable through the denormalized
// contacts.phones_normalized column (maintained by Contact.BeforeSave from
// every Phones[] entry and backfilled by migration 000020), indexed into
// contacts_fts as each number's full digit string plus its PhoneKey. A
// phone-shaped query (PhoneQueryTokens) is matched against the same two
// normalized forms, so a query typed with different punctuation, grouping, or
// country code than the stored value still finds the contact.
//
// Scoping: each FTS row carries user_id (UNINDEXED), and every query filters
// on it — the highest-risk correctness rule of the ticket, pinned by
// TestSearch_CrossUserReturnsNothing and TestSearch_CrossUserAddressDoesNotLeak.
// The base-table JOIN also re-scopes and re-filters soft-deleted rows
// (defense-in-depth on top of the triggers).

// interactions (activities). Query and any resolved relation synonym are
