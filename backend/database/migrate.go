// openDSN appends this app's standard connection pragmas to a plain file
// path:
//   - journal_mode(WAL): the SQLite concurrency mode this app runs in. It is
//     what allows readers and a writer to coexist without blocking, but it is
//     also why a plain `cp` of the .db file is NOT a valid online backup --
//     committed writes can sit in a -wal sidecar that the copy never sees.
//     The documented online backup uses VACUUM INTO (see database/backup.go
//     and docs/deployment.md's Backups section), which snapshots the live
//     database consistently. Persisted in the database file itself once set,
//     so this only needs to run against a real file, never ":memory:".
//   - foreign_keys(1): turns on real FK enforcement  --
//     unlike journal_mode this is a per-connection setting, not persisted in
//     the file, so it must be supplied via the DSN (applied by the driver on
//     every new physical connection it opens) rather than a one-time
//     PRAGMA statement, which would only affect whichever single connection
//     ran it.
//   - busy_timeout(5000): wait up to 5s for a write lock instead of
//     immediately returning SQLITE_BUSY. The scheduled jobs fire concurrently
//     at startup and the first one to INSERT into job_executions fails the
//     others; a timeout lets them queue instead.
//   - _txlock=immediate: begin every transaction with BEGIN IMMEDIATE rather
//     than SQLite's default deferred BEGIN.
//
// The last one is not cosmetic, and busy_timeout alone does not cover it. A
// deferred transaction takes a read lock first and only tries to upgrade to a
// write lock at its first write; SQLite's busy handler is NOT invoked for that
// upgrade (it cannot safely wait — another writer may already hold a snapshot),
// so the upgrade fails instantly with SQLITE_BUSY no matter how long the
// timeout is. GORM wraps even a single Create in an implicit transaction, so
// two concurrent POSTs to a write endpoint could produce an immediate 500:
//
//	POST /api/v1/contacts -> 500 "database is locked (5) (SQLITE_BUSY)" in 4.8ms
//
// observed intermittently under the e2e suite's parallel workers, and equally
// reachable by a real client issuing concurrent writes. BEGIN IMMEDIATE takes
// the write lock up front, which IS a case the busy handler retries, so
// concurrent writers queue for up to busy_timeout instead of erroring.
// Readers are unaffected: WAL keeps them lock-free.
