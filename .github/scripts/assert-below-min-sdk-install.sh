# COMPAT-02 (issue #473): assert that a device one API level BELOW the app's
# declared minSdk (26) refuses to install the debug APK outright, and does so
# with the comprehensible INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK error rather than some
# opaque failure. Proves the minSdk declaration reaches the merged manifest and
# is enforced by PackageManager -- not that Android itself works.
#
# Invoked from android-tests.yml's `android-below-min-sdk` job, inside the
# reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner `script:`. That action runs each
# physical line of an inline script in its own shell, so a multi-line inline
# script cannot share `$apk` or a `set +e` across lines -- hence a real script
# file here, where `set -e`, the APK lookup and the control flow all live in
# one process.

# Issue #1133: AGP nests APK outputs as apk/<flavor>/<buildType>/; the job
# assembles the gold-standard obtainium debug variant.
