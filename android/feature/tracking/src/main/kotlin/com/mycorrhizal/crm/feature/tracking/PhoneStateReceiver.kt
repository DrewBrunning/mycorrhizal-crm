/**
 * Reacts to phone-state changes to stage finished calls (§6.1). Runs the
 * CallLogSyncWorker on every state change: it is idempotent because the
 * worker reads only calls newer than the persisted watermark, so the final
 * IDLE broadcast (call ended) picks up the just-finished call and earlier
 * RINGING/OFFHOOK broadcasts stage nothing new. This avoids relying on
 * cross-broadcast static state, which manifest receivers can't safely keep.
