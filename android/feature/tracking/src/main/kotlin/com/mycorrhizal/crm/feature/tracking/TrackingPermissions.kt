/**
 * Issue #721: the dangerous OS permissions each opt-in tracking toggle needs.
 *
 * These are the single source of truth for the permission sets — the Settings
 * screen requests exactly one of these arrays when a toggle is turned on, and
 * the capture workers gate on the same grants before touching a provider.
 *
 * Issue #1200: the `play` flavor does not offer the capture feature at all, so
 * it removes these permissions from its merged manifest and hides the toggles
 * (`CallSmsTrackingCapability`). That is a build-level exclusion, deliberately
 * NOT a change to these arrays — `obtainium` and `foss` keep requesting
 * exactly these sets.
