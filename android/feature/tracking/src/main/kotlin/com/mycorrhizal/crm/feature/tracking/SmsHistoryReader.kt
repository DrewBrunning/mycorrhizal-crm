/**
 * Reads the *sent* SMS folder (§6.2, issue #721). The incoming-SMS broadcast
 * (SmsReceiver) cannot observe texts the user sends — there is no outbound
 * broadcast another app can register for — so outgoing texts are captured by
 * periodically reading the Sent folder and are gated on the READ_SMS grant.
 *
 * The reader deliberately never touches the Inbox: incoming SMS are owned by
 * the broadcast path, and the broadcast + provider timestamp a message
 * differently (PDU header vs provider row date) while the outbox deletes rows
 * once synced — so no watermark or exact-match dedupe can reliably stop a
 * provider Inbox read from double-logging a message the broadcast already
 * captured. Keeping one writer per folder makes duplicates impossible.
 *
 * Only the sender address + timestamp are kept — never the message body
 * (§6.2 privacy boundary).
