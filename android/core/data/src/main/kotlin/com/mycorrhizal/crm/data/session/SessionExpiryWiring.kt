/**
 * Glue between the network layer's 401 detection and the session store (issue
 * #678): every session-expiry signal ends the session, which flips the app to
 * the auth flow. Kept as its own class rather than inline in DI so the
 * behavior is unit-testable — the session must never survive a 401.
 *
 * Issue #722: when this install holds a device grant, the 401 first tries one
 * grant exchange ([refresher]) — a session that expired because its JWT ran
 * out is seamlessly renewed on a device whose owner already passed the local
 * biometric gate. Only when that refresh fails (grant revoked / network
 * rejected) — or when no grant is enrolled, the default — does the session
 * clear. A grant that the server has revoked therefore still ends exactly as
 * a 401 always has.
 *
 * Issue #957 (finding #1, point 2) — re-entrancy guard
 * ([SessionManager.isClearingSession]): [clearSession]'s own authenticated
 * teardown step (FCM deregister, session revoke) makes network calls with
 * the bearer being invalidated right now, so it can 401 too. Without this
 * guard that 401 would attempt a grant exchange — silently logging the user
 * back in seconds after an explicit logout.
