/**
 * The capability gate for issue #692: given the server version a session
 * resolved from /health (issue #528, the single source of truth), does the
 * connected server support a [ServerFeature]?
 *
 * ## Fail-open rule
 *
 * A null server version (no /health yet, an unreachable/misbehaving /health, an
 * unparseable version such as an unstamped "dev" build) resolves to
 * "supported": the client must never hide functionality because it could not
 * confirm the server's version. This mirrors the fail-open posture of
 * [CompatibilityResolver] — an unreachable /health must not degrade the app.
 *
 * ## The baseline
 *
 * [MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_VERSION] is the oldest server this app will talk to
 * (1.0.0, matching the backend's migration floor; raised from 0.6.0 at the
 * 1.0.0 major release, issue #1170). A server that reports an
 * older-but-parseable version makes the whole authenticated surface unusable,
 * which is the "server too old" blocking gate in the root — see
 * [isServerSupported].
