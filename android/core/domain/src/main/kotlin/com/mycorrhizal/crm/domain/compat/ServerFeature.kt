/**
 * The exhaustive registry of server-backed capabilities this app can present
 * to a user, each with the oldest server release that provides it (issue #692).
 *
 * This is the "feature → minServerVersion" map the issue calls for. It is the
 * single place a floor lives for a UI surface: a screen that offers a
 * capability checks [ServerCapabilities.isSupported] against the server version
 * the session fetched from /health (once per session, issue #528) and hides or
 * disables the entry point when the connected server predates [minServerVersion].
 *
 * ## How a floor is chosen
 *
 * A floor is the FIRST server release whose route table shipped the endpoints a
 * capability needs — derived from the git tags rather than invented. The whole
 * authenticated surface shares one baseline,
 * [ServerCapabilities.MIN_SUPPORTED_SERVER_VERSION] (v1.0.0): a server below the
 * baseline is refused outright (the "server too old" gate), and every
 * capability that exists at all ships by the baseline, so a supported server
 * provides everything.
 *
 * The per-capability floors below are historical: each names the v0.x release
 * whose route table first shipped the endpoints (e.g. /admin/system-events* in
 * v0.6.2, /audit/export in v0.6.1, device grants in v0.6.10). Every one of them
 * is below the v1.0.0 baseline, so the baseline gate dominates and none of them
 * hides anything on a supported server. They survive as the map a future floor
 * raise edits: a capability added after v1.0.0 gets a floor above the baseline,
 * which is the only case [ServerCapabilities.isSupported] can act on.
 *
 * Raising a floor (moving a capability onto a newer server) is a MAINT-02
 * breaking-change event and needs a recorded rationale, exactly like the
 * server-side MIN_CLIENT_VERSION floor (docs/client-compatibility-policy.md).
 *
 * Entry points whose capability is baseline-floored are NOT individually
 * gated in their screens: the "server too old" gate above the whole tree makes
 * those checks tautological, and gating them would be dead code. This registry
 * still lists them so the map is complete and a future floor raise on any of
 * them is a data-only change.
